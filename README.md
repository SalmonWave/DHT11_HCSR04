This repository contains Verilog projects developed using the BASYS-3 board.
<br/><br/>
## Features

### DHT-11 Overview
The DHT11 is a low-cost digital sensor designed to measure temperature and humidity, using a proprietary single-wire serial communication protocol. 

### HC-SR04 Overview
The HC-SR04 is an ultrasonic sensor used to measure distance by calculating the time taken for ultrasonic sound waves to travel to and from an object, using a trigger and echo mechanism. 

### Multi-Functional Clock Overview
A multi-functional clock is a versatile device offering the following features:

- Time Display: Shows current time in hours and minutes.
- High-Precision Time Display: Displays time in seconds and milliseconds for finer accuracy.
- Stopwatch Function: Measures elapsed time with start, stop, and reset capabilities.
